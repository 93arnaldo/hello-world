# hello-world
Hello World! Here I will post ideas, small scripts and my first steps as coder

I currently code in Python although I'm starting to learn Java and CSS. I love Data Science because it's a field where there are not right or wrong answers, just big problems which requires big ideas and solutions to solve the. that's what I love to do and that's what I want to go after.

Munchkin is my favourite board game and I'm currently super into Hollow Knight and Rocket League in PS4 (when I have time). Apart form that I love snowboarding, run and rowing. It's great to start something new and I feel very happy to be able to grow as a coder, learn from the community and share my ideas. 

Feel free to ask any questions.

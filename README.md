# hello-world
Hello World! Here I will post ideas, small scripts and my first steps as coder

I mainly code in Python although I'm starting to learn Java and CSS. I love Data Science and that's where I want to go after. 
Munchkin is my favourite board game and I'm currently super into Hollow Knight and Rocket League in PS4 (when I have time). Apart form that I love snowboarding, run and rowing. It's great to start something new and I feel very happy to be able to grow as a coder, learn from the community and share my ideas. 

Feel free to ask any questions.
